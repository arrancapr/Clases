					Hey, Macklemore! Can we go thrift shopping?<br>
					<br>
					What, what, what, what... <i>[x8]</i><br>
					<br>
					Bada, bada, badadada <i>[x8]</i><br>
					<br>
					<i>[Hook:]</i><br>
					I'm gonna pop some tags<br>
					Only got twenty dollars in my pocket<br>
					I - I - I'm hunting, looking for a come-up<br>
					This is fucking awesome<br>
					<br>
					<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br>
					Nah, walk up to the club like, "What up? I got a big cock!"<br>
					I'm so pumped about some shit from the thrift shop<br>
					Ice on the fringe, it's so damn frosty<br>
					That people like, "Damn! That's a cold ass honkey."<br>
					Rollin' in, hella deep, headin' to the mezzanine,<br>
					Dressed in all pink, 'cept my gator shoes, those are green<br>
					Draped in a leopard mink, girls standin' next to me<br>
					Probably shoulda washed this, smells like R. Kelly's sheets<br>
					(Piiisssssss)<br>
					But shit, it was ninety-nine cents! (Bag it)<br>
					Coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments<br>
					Passin' up on those moccasins someone else's been walkin' in<br>
					Bummy and grungy, fuck it, man<br>
					I am stuntin' and flossin' and<br>
					Savin' my money and I'm hella happy that's a bargain, bitch<br>
					I'm a take your grandpa's style, I'm a take your grandpa's style,<br>
					No for real - ask your grandpa - can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you)<br>
					Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers<br>
					Dookie brown leather jacket that I found diggin'<br>
					They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard<br>
					I bought a ski blanket, then I bought a kneeboard<br>
					Hello, hello, my ace man, my Mello<br>
					John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no<br>
					I could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those<br>
					The sneaker heads would be like "Aw, he got the Velcros"<br>
					<br>
					<i>[Hook x2]</i><br>
					<br>
					<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br>
					What you know about rockin' a wolf on your noggin?<br>
					What you knowin' about wearin' a fur fox skin?<br>
					I'm digging, I'm digging, I'm searching right through that luggage<br>
					One man's trash, that's another man's come-up<br>
					Thank your granddad for donating that plaid button-up shirt<br>
					'Cause right now I'm up in her skirt<br>
					I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the (Uptons)<br>
					I'm not, I'm not stuck, I'm searchin' in that section (Uptons)<br>
					Your grammy, your aunty, your momma, your mammy<br>
					I'll take those flannel zebra jammies, second-hand, I rock that motherfucker<br>
					The built-in onesie with the socks on that motherfucker<br>
					I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker<br>
					They be like, "Oh, that Gucci - that's hella tight."<br>
					I'm like, "Yo - that's fifty dollars for a T-shirt."<br>
					Limited edition, let's do some simple addition<br>
					Fifty dollars for a T-shirt - that's just some ignorant bitch (shit)<br>
					I call that getting swindled and pimped (shit)<br>
					I call that getting tricked by a business<br>
					That shirt's hella dough<br>
					And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't<br>
					Peep game, come take a look through my telescope<br>
					Tryna get girls from a brand and you hella won't<br>
					Man you hella won't<br>
					<br>
					(Goodwill... poppin' tags... yeah!)<br>
					<br>
					<i>[Hook]</i><br>
					<br>
					<i>[Bridge:]</i><br>
					I wear your granddad's clothes<br>
					I look incredible<br>
					I'm in this big ass coat<br>
					From that thrift shop down the road<br>
					I wear your granddad's clothes (damn right)<br>
					I look incredible (now come on man)<br>
					I'm in this big ass coat (big ass coat)<br>
					From that thrift shop down the road (let's go)<br>
					<br>
					<i>[Hook]</i><br>
					<br>
					Is that your grandma's coat?
